It was a small experience because of time schedule, although, I got to see most of the process that was made, and got to work with really nice people. I mainly worked on the UI of 'Places to Eat & Drink', based on wireframes, desktop and mobile version. It's an experience I'd love to try again next year, much more earlier to give myself more time on it."
