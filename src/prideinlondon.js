          I got to work on the Pride in London website, as a volunteer. It was a small experience because of time schedule, although, I got to see most of the process that was made, and got to work with really nice people. I mainly worked on the UI of 'Places to Eat & Drink', based on wireframes, desktop and mobile version. It's an experience I'd love to try again next year, much more earlier to give myself more time on it.

          To create this interface, I used Sketch, my personal favorite, combined with InVision for the interaction and the sharing.
